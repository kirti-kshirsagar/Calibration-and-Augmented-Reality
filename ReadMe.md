# README - Project 4
Name - **KIRTI KSHIRSAGAR** & **SAIKIRAN JUTTU**

- Using Windows 10, VScode, CMake,OpenCV 4.9(recent one) and C++.
- Using 1 Time Travel Day (submitting on 19th March 2024)
- Extension : Keypress 'p' activates the pre-captured video containing the target.

## This is a Readme file for main.cpp, task456.cpp and task7.cpp file and this includes all the details that are necessary to run the program.

The main.cpp file contains tasks from 1 to 3, task456.cpp file contains tasks from 4 to 6 and task 7 is present in task7.cpp. The multiple.cpp file contains the extension where our system can detect and create virtual objects on multiple targets in the frame. The overlay.cpp contains the extension to not only add a virtual object, but also overlay an image to the target to make it not look like a target any more. 

### Task-1
-  In this task, we build a system for detecting a target and extracting target corners from live camera feed. We use the provided checkerboard as target image. Here, we have printed out the number of corners, along with the coordinates of the first corner.

### Task-2
- This task lets the user select images for calibration. In this task, upon pressing **s**, we let the user specify that a particular image should be used for the calibration and save the corner locations and the corresponding 3D world points.

### Task-3
- In this task, we calibrated the camera if the user has selected minimum of 5 images for calibration. We used **cv::calibrateCamera** function to generate the calibration and printed camera matrix and distortion coefficients before and after the calibration. We also calculated and printed Re-projection Error after the calibration has been done. 
- We are saving the rotation and translation associated with each calibration image in a file. Also, the intrinsic parameters are getting saved to a file for furthur tasks.

### Task-4
-  In this task we calculated the rotation and translation vector of the camera using solvePNP function and we printed them in the terminal.
### Task-5
-  In this task we are used projectPoints function to project the 3D points corresponding to at least four corners of the target onto the image plane in real time as the target or camera moves around. We also used it to project 3D Axes at the origin by connecting the points using arrowed lines.
### Task-6
-  In this task we used projectPoints function to project the 3D points and create a virtual object in the image space.
### Task-7
-  In this task we used cv::cornerHarris function to detect the corners in the image in a video stream. We used it to detect corners on the same checkerboard image.
# Extension:
For the extensions, we have done the following tasks:
- Task 1 : We have enabled our system to use pre-captured video sequences with targets and demonstrated inserting virtual objects into the scenes.
    * The conversion from live feed to the pre-captured video takes place upon keypress **p**. [Attached Demo of this task](https://drive.google.com/file/d/103mUiSgL6q1pJ2LhHZq8z1r2gVORhIdA/view?usp=sharing)
- Task 2 : Test out several different cameras and compare the calibrations and quality of the results. 
    * For this task, we have compared the results from my **laptop integrated web cam** and **external web cam**.
- Task 3 : Get your system working with multiple targets in the scene.
    * For this task,We have successfully implemented our system to function with multiple checkerboards in the frame. Utilizing checkerboards of sizes (9,6) and (6,6).
- Task 4 : Not only add a virtual object, but also do something to the target to make it not look like a target any more.
    * In this task, we detected the extreme corners of the checkerboard and superimposed an image within that region.
